[Dyson has scrapped its electric car project.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50004184) Sir James Dyson sent an email to all employees last week, and  he wrote :

> "We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable."

What was the reason for that?  Dyson launched the project in 2016 and planned to invest more than Â£2bn to develop an electric car.

> "The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies."

He said the electric car has been developed but it would not be commercially viable. If this is true, I think they had some problems with production. What many people overlook is that developing an electric car is easy, but production is a totally different matter. Even Tesla also struggled to meet production schedules due to problems in the manufacturing plant last couple of years. Many electric carmakers in China have been developing electric cars, but none of them have achieved mass production with high quality, which are the most important factors for success in the automotive industry. Earlier this year, Dyson was still posting on LinkedIn to recruit production engineering head and production technology experts. Though it is supposed to complete an electric car manufacturing plant in Singapore by 2020, it seems that they could not get enough production engineers to proceed to manufacture.

Dyson made the bagless vacuum cleaner, a result of significant technological advances. I also have used this vacuum cleaner, but its finishing quality and durability could not satisfy me. I think that Dyson was unable to meet the production quality of cars, required higher in developing electric cars. Even if it is an electric car, the car is the product that has a higher level of technical complexity in product development. It shows that traditional carmakers may still have an edge in the field of electric vehicles or eco-friendly cars in the future.
