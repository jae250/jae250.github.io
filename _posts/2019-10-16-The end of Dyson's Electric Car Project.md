[Dyson has scrapped its electric car project.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50004184) Sir James Dyson sent an email to all employees last week, and  he wrote :

> "We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable."

What was the reason for that?  Dyson launched the project in 2016 and planned to invest more than Â£2bn to develop an electric car.

> "The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies."
