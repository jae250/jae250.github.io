The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) conditionally approved a business combination in which Delivery Hero SE acquires approximately 88% of the shares of Woowa Brothers Corp. on 28 Dec 2020. Delivery Hero SE is a German-based global food delivery app provider with Delivery Hero Korea (operating the delivery app “Yogiyo”) and Bdtong (operating the delivery app “Baedaltong) as its subsidiaries in Korea. Woowa Brothers Corp. is the No. 1 food delivery app operator in Korea, “Baemin (People of Delivery). As a result of reviewing the merger, KFTC decided to impose measures for DH to sell all of DHK's shares (100%). DH must sell its Yogiyo business within six months and it was allowed to apply for an extension of the period within the range of 6 months.

The market share of Baemin was 78% and that of Yogiyo was 19.6% in 2019. Yogiyo's corporate value is estimated to be around US$1.8B. Other competitors such as Coupang Eats, Kakao, and Naver take less than 5% of the market share in 2020.

Potential candidates to take over Yogiyo are Kakao and Coupang at this time. DH may not sell Yogiyo to Coupang, which is expected to be the strongest competitor for the future. It is known that Naver, which is an investor of Woowa Brothers, has a restricted condition of its entry into similar industries. On the other hands, Takeaway or DoorDash would be interested in the merger of Yogiyo to expand their overseas business.
